Created by Caym Katko to inhabit his pocket dimension, each Daemari is a reflection of purpose, power, and memory twisted into form. Their races aren’t bound by biology, but by function—each tailored for a role in Dysmaera’s hierarchy of desire, decay, and control.
Color isn’t just appearance. It’s rank. It’s temperament. It’s the echo of the god-thought that made them. Some burn bright and volatile. Others fade into gray obedience. None are truly stable.
This page will break down the known races, their color systems, traits, and the unspoken rules that govern what they are… and what they’re allowed to become.</p>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Daemari of Dysmaera</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> In
 Dysmaera, the Daemari have created a society that mirrors the 
complexity and structure of mortal civilizations, complete with bustling
 cities, industrialized sectors, and advanced technologies. The 
cityscape is a mix of towering structures made of stone and metallic 
alloys, housing a variety of specialized districts, from administrative 
offices and sacred temples to residential areas and industrial hubs. 
Their society thrives on the balance between tradition and modernity, 
with cutting-edge technology integrated seamlessly into their everyday 
lives. Machines, powered by magical energy, facilitate much of the labor
 force, enabling the Daemari to perform everything from crafting 
religious artifacts to transporting goods across vast distances. The 
younger generations, who have grown up amidst technological advancements
 and the comforts of industrial progress, are often more dismissive of 
the deep-rooted traditions that have been passed down through the 
centuries. They tend to prioritize innovation and self-expression, 
focusing on personal achievements rather than the collective religious 
duties their elders hold dear.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In
 contrast, the older generations of Daemari remain deeply connected to 
the religious and cultural practices that have long been the backbone of
 their society. For them, maintaining tradition is vital not only for 
the stability of Dysmaera but for the preservation of their identity as 
Daemari. They value the teachings of the Blue Daemari, who are seen as 
spiritual leaders and keepers of ancient wisdom. The older Daemari 
believe that without proper reverence for their divine roles and the way
 they interact with the mortal realm, their society would lose its 
purpose and fall into decay. They prioritize religious rituals and 
ceremonies, with many living their lives based on the teachings of the 
faith. These practices are seen as crucial for ensuring the health and 
harmony of the Daemari race, ensuring that the mortal world continues to
 receive the blessings they offer through prayers and intercession. 
There is a cultural push for younger Daemari to respect and continue 
these sacred traditions, though this often leads to tension between the 
generations.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite
 their reverence for tradition, Daemari society is not without its 
flaws. Although they can live up to 100 years, they are not immortal, 
and illness or injury can take a Daemari's life, reminding them of their
 finite existence. This recognition of mortality has led to advancements
 in healthcare and medicine, though death is still an unavoidable part 
of life. The government is heavily influenced by religious officials who
 oversee the management of the society’s spiritual obligations and 
manage the demands of the mortal realm. These officials, largely Blue 
Daemari, wield significant power, ensuring that the prayers of the 
mortals are handled with care and that the interdimensional connections 
remain intact. However, the secular and religious spheres of their 
society are intricately linked, and many of the high-ranking officials 
also hold powerful positions within the government. The separation of 
church and state is practically nonexistent in Dysmaera; religious 
duties directly influence societal roles, and everything from politics 
to daily work revolves around the proper maintenance of their divine 
duties. This centralized, faith-driven government has allowed their 
society to remain stable for centuries, but the tensions between the 
desire for innovation from the younger generations and the older 
generations’ staunch conservatism could eventually lead to a cultural 
shift. The future of Dysmaera lies in the balance between its deep 
reverence for tradition and the inevitable march toward modernization.<br>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Blue Daemari</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> The
 Blue Daemari are the most revered and powerful caste within the society
 of Dysmaera, regarded almost as lesser gods due to their strength, 
magical prowess, and divine roles. As the spiritual leaders of the 
Daemari, they are deeply entrenched in religious duties, serving as high
 priests, religious counselors, and intermediaries between the mortal 
realm and their own. Their lives are centered around the upkeep of 
sacred rituals, the management of prayers sent from mortals, and the 
overall spiritual health of their society. They hold prestigious 
positions, living in opulent residences within the capital city, where 
they are given utmost respect and admiration by the lower castes. Their 
magical abilities, which are honed through generations of spiritual 
practice, allow them to perform feats that no other Daemari can, such as
 bending reality or manipulating energies that interact with the mortal 
realm. They serve not only as guides for their people but also as the 
gatekeepers for the flow of divine power between Dysmaera and the mortal
 world, and they bear the sacred responsibility of ensuring that the 
Daemari race’s connection to their gods remains strong and pure.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The
 Blue Daemari are a small and tightly-knit community, with the 
bloodlines of powerful families maintaining a sense of exclusivity. They
 rarely mix with other colors of Daemari, as they believe their pure 
bloodline is essential to their divine power and position within 
society. Their families have traditions that stretch back centuries, 
often intertwining with the history of Dysmaera itself. The Blue Daemari
 are taught from an early age to adhere to strict codes of conduct, 
emphasizing loyalty to their gods, reverence for the ancient traditions,
 and the preservation of their sacred duties. They live by a hierarchy 
of spiritual knowledge and power, where older, more experienced Blue 
Daemari hold greater authority and responsibility within their religious
 roles. They are taught to be serene and composed, exuding a sense of 
calm and wisdom, as they are the ultimate examples of what the Daemari 
strive to be. In public, they are rarely seen without their ceremonial 
robes and regalia, which are imbued with ancient symbols meant to 
connect them to their divine power.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; While
 their lives are mostly devoted to religious service, the Blue Daemari 
also play key roles in the political landscape of Dysmaera. The most 
influential Blue Daemari serve in high governmental positions, where 
they oversee decisions that affect both the spiritual and secular 
aspects of society. Their counsel is highly sought after by the ruling 
leaders, as their magical abilities and profound understanding of the 
spiritual realm are seen as invaluable. However, despite their power and
 influence, their lives are far from carefree. They are bound by a 
strong sense of duty and are constantly reminded of their divine 
purpose. Their relationships with other Daemari castes are typically 
distant, as they are held to a higher standard and must avoid any 
actions that would tarnish their revered status. Despite the sacrifices 
they make for their divine duties, the Blue Daemari take great pride in 
their role as protectors and guides of their people, ensuring that the 
flow of divine power continues uninterrupted, and that the Daemari 
remain closely connected to their gods. Their existence is a constant 
balancing act between their sacred responsibilities and the pressures of
 maintaining their esteemed position within the rigid social structure 
of Dysmaera.<br>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Green Daemari</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> The
 Green Daemari form the backbone of Dysmaera’s society, making up the 
majority of the population. They are the workers, the builders, and the 
everyday citizens who drive the infrastructure and day-to-day operations
 of the pocket dimension. Known for their raw physical strength and 
resilience, Green Daemari fill a variety of roles across all sectors of 
society, from manual laborers to skilled tradesmen and even civil 
service workers. While they don’t hold the same level of prestige as the
 Blue Daemari, their contributions are vital to the functioning of the 
cities and communities. They are the face of Dysmaera’s bustling, 
industrialized society, ensuring that everything from transportation 
systems to markets runs smoothly. Because of their status as the working
 class, Green Daemari tend to live in more modest, yet still modern, 
housing near the city centers or in the suburban districts that surround
 the capital. Their strong sense of pride comes from their invaluable 
contributions, and they take great pride in their ability to endure 
physically demanding tasks, often bonding over shared experiences and 
camaraderie in the workforce.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike
 the Blue Daemari, the Green Daemari are much more integrated into 
society, interacting freely with all castes, and while their jobs may be
 considered less glamorous, they are respected for their indispensable 
role. They frequently hold religious positions, though they tend to 
focus on the more mundane, administrative aspects of the faith, 
processing prayers, organizing rituals, and managing the daily logistics
 of religious practices. While they are not the spiritual leaders, Green
 Daemari are crucial to ensuring that the work of the higher-ups runs 
smoothly. Many Green Daemari also find themselves in roles that directly
 support the Blue Daemari, such as personal attendants, caretakers, and 
religious assistants. Because they live in a highly structured society, 
they don’t question their status as the working class but rather embrace
 their role as a necessary part of the larger, divine system that 
governs their existence. They find purpose in their dedication to the 
maintenance of society, and their value is measured by their tireless 
work ethic and ability to support the spiritual hierarchy.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; While
 their lives are generally more focused on labor and practical duties, 
the Green Daemari do have a strong cultural identity rooted in physical 
strength and resilience. Their bond with the land and their society is 
reinforced through festivals, communal events, and shared efforts that 
celebrate their strength, unity, and endurance. There is an unspoken 
understanding among the Green Daemari that their work is integral to the
 prosperity of Dysmaera, and they are fiercely protective of their 
fellow workers. Family and community play a central role in their lives,
 and their social circles are often tightly knit. Though they may lack 
the magical aptitude of the Blue Daemari or the divine status, their 
collective efforts are what keep Dysmaera running. The Green Daemari’s 
culture reflects a balance of humility, hard work, and resilience, as 
they continue to ensure that the society they help build remains stable 
and thriving, even as the political and religious elite hold the power.<br>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Yellow Daemari</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> The
 Yellow Daemari occupy the lowest rungs of society in Dysmaera, often 
relegated to the tasks that no other Daemari group wants to take on. 
While the Green Daemari are known for their raw strength and physical 
prowess, the Yellow Daemari are considered to be even lower on the 
social ladder. Their roles are typically menial—working in janitorial 
positions, waste management, and other jobs that involve physical labor 
or unpleasant duties that the Green Daemari deem beneath them. Despite 
this, the Yellow Daemari’s intelligence and sharp minds give them an 
edge in tasks such as accounting, managing resources, and handling 
complex calculations that others might find too tedious. While they may 
perform the more undesirable tasks, they are often the unsung heroes 
when it comes to keeping the infrastructure running smoothly, from 
financial transactions to ensuring that the supply chain within Dysmaera
 never breaks down.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Because
 of their lower status, the Yellow Daemari have developed a deep sense 
of solidarity and unity, bonding over the adversity they face on a daily
 basis. Their communities are extremely close-knit, often forming tight,
 familial-like networks where mutual support is a critical part of their
 existence. Their shared struggles with being looked down upon by both 
the Green and Blue Daemari have forged a strong bond between them. They 
are fiercely loyal to one another, with traditions and values passed 
down from generation to generation that emphasize perseverance, 
resourcefulness, and survival against the odds. Although they are the 
lowest in society, their resilience has made them a crucial component in
 the workforce, and they take great pride in their ability to endure the
 hardships of their station without ever complaining. In this way, they 
embody the very spirit of the underdog, finding strength in their 
numbers and their shared experience of oppression.<br>
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite
 their low status, the Yellow Daemari freely intermingle with the Green 
Daemari, often forming unions to improve their chances of social 
mobility. Because of their similar backgrounds and shared duties, 
relationships between the two groups are not only common but encouraged.
 The Yellow Daemari’s wisdom, born from years of being the most 
oppressed and marginalized, makes them valuable partners for the Green 
Daemari. They are often the ones who handle the day-to-day finances, 
managing budgets, and making sure that everything runs efficiently. The 
Yellow Daemari’s mathematical and financial acumen has earned them some 
respect in these areas, even though their social status remains low. 
Over time, the Yellow Daemari have learned to leverage their skills in 
areas such as money and administration, gaining some degree of influence
 in areas that others overlook. However, despite this, they remain at 
the bottom of the social hierarchy and are often overlooked by those 
higher in the caste system, even though their contribution is 
indispensable for Dysmaera to function.<br>
