              <br>"Hollice’s shoes tracked water across the marble as he stepped through the lobby. The doorman gave him a nod he didn’t return. The elevator doors opened fast, too fast, and he stepped inside like a man walking into a confessional booth. It was just him in there. Just his reflection in the brushed steel, shaky and faint, looking back like a stranger. He gripped the railing. Tight. The world tilted a little. He leaned into the corner, trying to breathe, trying to pretend the silence wasn’t screaming. Thirty-eight floors. He counted them in his head. Each number felt heavier than the last.<br>
              <br>The elevator doors peeled open with a soft chime, but to Hollice it sounded distant. Blunted. Like it had traveled through layers of cotton and fog to reach him. He stepped out into the corridor, slow, deliberate, like he wasn’t sure if the floor would hold him. The hallway was still. Dimly lit. The kind of silence reserved for spaces that cost far too much.<br>His door was already unlocked. The escort had let himself in—Hollice preferred it that way. It made things feel less like a transaction, more like a dream. Something he could wake up from without receipts. He entered.<br>
              <br>The lights were low inside. Music played faintly—someone’s attempt at setting a mood, though the ambiance only highlighted how empty everything felt. The escort—older, mature, shapely in a familiar way Hollice didn’t want to look at too long—was waiting in the living room with a drink in hand, posing like he was being paid to be art. Which he was.<br>Hollice didn’t speak. Just dropped his coat on the floor and walked past without a glance. The escort followed wordlessly."<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-5"> Hollice Katko is the unorthodox young boss of the Moonshot Casino, wielding sharp wit and ruthless strategy to keep his rivals off-balance. Chosen by a cruel coin flip at birth to bear suffering, he escaped abuse as a teen and built his empire from the shadows of Las Paraiso. Under his rule, the Moonshot thrives on blackmail, espionage, and the quiet art of reputation destruction. Driven by both ambition and addiction, Hollice walks a razor’s edge between control and chaos. Beneath his confident façade lies a fractured soul—haunted by the past, hungry for freedom, and secretly guided by powers he’s only beginning to understand. In a world where every deal is a gamble, Hollice plays for the highest stakes: his own fate.</p>

                <p class="u-gallery-text">Hollice's estranged father is the root of nearly all his issues, having placed immense pressure on him as a child. Despite their toxic and complex dynamic, Hollice still holds a significant part of his heart open for him. There are even unsettling implications that their relationship may have crossed inappropriate boundaries. Interestingly, Hollice didn’t run away because of his father’s abuse; instead, he fled to spare his father’s reputation, believing that a “no-good son” would only tarnish his father’s image.</p>

Years later, he resurfaces as Hollice's most dangerous adversary. Despite their newfound rivalry, Hollice remains hopelessly infatuated and convinces himself he can “fix” Faust's violent tendencies, often excusing his crimes in a desperate attempt to rekindle their connection.</p>

While Cassian considers them boyfriends, Hollice shies away from labeling their connection as a "relationship." Cassian is the healthiest and most stable intimate partner Hollice has ever known, a dynamic that both comforts and terrifies him. Understanding Hollice's struggle with sex addiction, Cassian tolerates an open relationship. He recognizes that imposing restrictions might push Hollice into more reckless behavior, opting instead to provide a supportive yet flexible space for Hollice to navigate his issues.</p>

Cloaking his divine nature behind the guise of a mob boss, Caym takes a twisted kind of pride in pushing Hollice toward his godly potential. While he genuinely cares for Hollice, his methods are often ruthless and his motives unclear, blending fatherly affection with a streak of self-serving cunning. Hollice admires Caym but remains wary, never quite sure if he’s a savior or just another puppeteer.</p>

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> In depth overview of Hollice's life pre-story</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> Early Years<br>
          <br> Hollice Katko was born on July 17th, 4650, on an unknown planet, 
alongside his twin brother, Horatius. After birth, both were taken from 
their mother, who was said to have died due to complications during 
childbirth. In reality, she was disposed of. The twins were raised under
 the care of various nannies, tutors, and caretakers, never truly 
knowing their father, Orias, who was rarely present. At the age of five,
 Orias entered their lives, presenting himself as a hardworking 
businessman who had returned to secure a future for his children, 
although his true motives were far darker.<br>
          <br> Childhood<br>
          <br> Orias’s return to their lives marked a significant shift. While Horatius
 became the favored child, receiving everything he wanted and evading 
much responsibility, Hollice, the elder twin, was held to impossible 
standards. Orias imposed harsh expectations on him, pushing him in every
 area of life: manners, education, hobbies, and more. Hollice became a 
child prodigy, constantly anxious and under pressure, never receiving 
praise or affection from his father—except in their private, personal 
moments. In these moments, Orias’s “praise” was twisted, often sexual in
 nature, but Hollice clung to it as a rare form of validation.<br>
          <br>&nbsp;At 15, Hollice and Horatius were enrolled in college. While Horatius 
received easy courses, Hollice was burdened with difficult, unfamiliar 
subjects. Despite his best efforts, Hollice struggled to maintain 
acceptable grades—just B’s and one C. This failure enraged Orias, who 
criticized him harshly, calling him ungrateful. In a fit of anger, Orias
 sent Hollice to boot camp over the summer, hoping to discipline him 
further. <br>
          <br>Running Away &amp; Teenage Years<br>
          <br> At the age of 16, after months of emotional and academic abuse, Hollice 
ran away from the transport heading to boot camp. He felt it would be 
easier for his father to focus on Horatius's successes and forget about 
his failures. Hollice floated between space pit stops, selling his body 
in various shady locations, surviving by any means necessary, as he 
drifted through the darkest corners of the galaxy.<br>
          <br> New Beginnings<br>
          <br> At 18, Hollice washed up in Las Paraíso, a gambling haven on the 
borderlands and a popular vacation spot for the wealthy. He quickly lost
 all the money he had, gambling in the city's many casinos. To survive, 
he joined the Moonshot Crime Family, starting as a low-level associate. 
After a year, Hollice became more involved in the family’s operations 
and befriended Faust Von Luck, his future confidant and partner in 
crime.
​
Relationship with Faust<br>
          <br> Hollice and Faust quickly became close, working together on various jobs
 and later specializing as a pair of assassins. Faust’s ruthlessness 
became more apparent as he grew more sadistic in his work, while Hollice
 remained uncomfortable with the violence. The two eventually moved in 
together, and for a time, Hollice found stability and comfort in their 
relationship. However, Faust’s increasingly cruel behavior began to 
strain their connection. During one particularly brutal job, Faust 
killed an innocent child, which broke Hollice. The two had a violent 
altercation, culminating in Hollice pushing Faust off a building. 
Hollice was devastated, and Faust was declared dead. Hollice never got 
to say goodbye, and the guilt of their last conversation haunted him 
deeply. <br>
          <br>Change of Pace<br>
          <br> Devastated by the loss of Faust, Hollice sank into a deep depression but
 eventually switched roles within the mob, transitioning into 
management. Within a year, he gained respect and was mentored by 
Mortimer, the regional boss, who quickly took a personal interest in 
Hollice. Mortimer provided the care and guidance that Hollice had never 
received from his father, filling a void in his life. The two developed a
 sexual relationship, and Hollice began to look up to Mortimer as a 
father figure.<br> However, this relationship created tension with Mortimer's other capos. 
Cliff, Mortimer’s right-hand man, grew resentful of Hollice's rise to 
favor and plotted to kill Mortimer. He framed Hollice for the murder and
 took Mortimer’s position as the new Kingpin.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Rebounding<br>
          <br> In the wake of Mortimer’s death and the mob turning against him, Hollice
 transformed his grief into anger and ambition. He decided to stay on 
Las Paraíso to seek revenge on Cliff. Hollice went into hiding at a 
brothel, where he met Belvedere, a sexbot, and together with Lou Carver,
 a former mobster turned private investigator, they began gathering 
evidence to prove Hollice’s innocence. After nearly a year of 
preparation, Hollice confronted Cliff publicly, challenging him to a 
duel. Hollice, always malnourished and lacking in physical strength, was
 outmatched. However, in a desperate and bloody fight, Hollice manages 
to wrestle Cliff's gun away and kill him.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>New Leadership<br>
          <br> Hollice’s victory over Cliff cleared his name and earned the support of 
Silvano Torell, a former ally of Mortimer. Silvano vouched for Hollice, 
pushing for him to become the new Kingpin. Hollice, though still 
recovering from his injuries, accepted the position and became the new 
crime lord of Las Paraíso.<br> However, Cliff's loyalists formed a terrorist group called the Ladder 
Men, targeting Hollice and the more progressive bosses in the city. 
Faust, who had somehow survived, infiltrated the group, vowing to make 
Hollice’s life miserable without killing him, seeking to bring out the 
"monster" he believed Hollice had become.<br>
          <br> Rekindling with Family<br>
          <br> As Hollice rose to power and solidified his position as Kingpin of Las 
Paraíso, he began to grapple with his estranged relationship with his 
family. His twin brother, Horatius, remained distant, content to stay 
out of Hollice’s turbulent world, but Orias, his father, resurfaced, 
rekindling a toxic, manipulative bond. Orias, ever the controlling 
figure, sought to claim Hollice back under his influence, reminding him 
of his divine heritage and imposing his will. Hollice, however, was no 
longer the frightened boy he once was. As he navigated his own criminal 
empire, he started to confront his father's abusive grip, conflicted by 
his inherited sense of duty and the desire to escape the suffocating 
expectations. Though their relationship remained fraught with tension, 
Hollice found moments of clarity in his growing power, realizing that 
his fight wasn’t just against the mob or Faust—it was against his 
father’s legacy and the chains of his past.<br>
